2. **Analytics View:** Provides detailed analytics for selected videos, including likes, views, and sentiment analysis of top comments.
3. **Summarization:** Summarizes video transcripts using various models.

## Configuration

Before running the application, you need to configure your YouTube Data API key. Follow the steps below:

1. **Get YouTube Data API Key:**

   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard" and click on the "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button.
   - Search for "YouTube Data API v3" and enable it for your project.
   - Once enabled, go to "Credentials" and create an API key.

2. **Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in `app.py`:**
   - Open the `app.py` file.
   - Locate the line with `API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'`.
   - Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with the API key you obtained from the Google Cloud Console.

```python
# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual YouTube Data API key
API_KEY = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY'
```

3.Run the Flask application:
 ```bash
python app.py
```
4.Access the application at http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
